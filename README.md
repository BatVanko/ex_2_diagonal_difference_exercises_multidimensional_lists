# ex_2_diagonal_difference_exercises_multidimensional_lists

Write a program that finds the difference between the sums of the square matrix diagonals (absolute value).

On the first line, you will receive an integer N - the size of a square matrix. The following N lines hold the values for each column - N numbers separated by a single space. Print the absolute difference between the primary and the secondary diagonal sums.

Input
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Output
15

Comments
Primary diagonal: sum = 11 + 5 + (-12) = 4
Secondary diagonal: sum = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

Input
4
-7 14 9 -20
3 4 9 21
-14 6 8 44
30 9 7 -14

Output

34
